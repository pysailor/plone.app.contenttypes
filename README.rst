Introduction
============

plone.app.contenttypes offers default content types for Plone based on Dexterity. This package is a replacement for Products.ATContenttypes.

**Warning: plone.app.contenttypes is best used when creating a new site from scratch. Using it on a site with existing content is not recommended if you don't know exactly what you're doing!**

It contains the same types as default Plone does:

* Folder
* Document
* News item
* File
* Image
* Link
* Event (this will be replaced by plone.app.event in the future)
* Collection (this is provided by plone.app.collection)

The main difference from a users perspective is that these types are extendable through-the-web. This means you can go to the control-panel (``.../@@dexterity-types``) and add or remove fields and behaviors for the existing types.

The aim is to mimick the old default-types as closely as possible.


Compatability
-------------

plone.app.contenttypes works with Plone 4.2+


Installation
------------

Add this line in the eggs section of your ``buildout.cfg``::

    eggs =
        ...
        plone.app.contenttypes


You also have to pin the 2.x version of ``plone.app.collection`` to get the deterity-based collections instead of the Archetypes-based collection shipped since Plone 4.2. The latest version at the time of writing is 2.0b4 but you might want to check http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.collection if there is a new version::

    [versions]
    plone.app.collection = 2.0b4


What happens to old content?
----------------------------

The old content still exists and can be visited but can't be edited any more. On installation plone.app.contenttypes removes the type-definitions for the old default-types like this::

    <object name="Document" remove="True" />

You can migrate the old items to the types provided by plone.app.contenttypes (see the section about migrations).

Migration
---------

**Warning: Migrations are still in an very early stage and might break your site! plone.app.contenttypes is best used when creating a new site from scratch. Please proceed at your own risk!**

This version plone.app.contenttypes comes with migrations for the following use-cases:

* from default Archetypes-based types to plone.app.contenttypes
* from older versions of plone.app.contenttypes to current versions

Migrations that will be will come in the future:

* from default ATEvent to plone.app.event ()
* from old p.a.c.-event to plone.app.event
* from ATTopic to DX-plone.app.collections
* from AT-plone.app.collection to DX-plone.app.collections


Migrating Archetypes-based content to plone.app.contenttypes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

plone.app.contenttypes can migrate the following types:

* Folder
* Document
* News item
* File
* Image
* Link

To migrate existing content go to ``/@@migrate_from_atct``.


Migrating content that is translated with LinguaPlone
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Warning: This use-case has not yet been thoroughly tested!***

Since LinguaPlone does not support Dexterity you need to migrate from LinguaPlone to plone.app.multilingual (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.multilingual). The migration from Products.LinguaPlone to plone.app.multilingual should happen **before** the migration from Archetypes to plone.app.contenttypes. For details on the migration see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.app.multilingual#linguaplone-migration


Migrating from old versions of plone.app.contenttypes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Before version 1.0a2 the content-items did not implement marker-interfaces. They will break in newer versions since the views are now registered for these interfaces (e.g. ``plone.app.contenttypes.interfaces.IDocument`). To fix this you can call the view ``/@@fix_base_classes`` on your site-root.



Migrating content that was extended with archetypes.schemaextender
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The migration should warn you if your typs are extended with archetypes.schemaextender. The data contained in these fields will be lost.


How to create a new page with only Dexterity
--------------------------------------------

You have two options:

**1. By hand**

Installing plone.app.contenttypes remove the types automatically, you only have to remove the existing content (front-page, events, news, members).


**2. Automatically**

If you start from scratch you can want to try using a special branch of Products.CMFPlone that gives you the choice between Dexterity and Archetypes when creating a new site. This way you get a brand new site with

Modify your buildout to automatically pull the branch using mr.developer (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mr.developer)::

    [buildout]
    extensions = mr.developer
    auto-checkout =
        Products.CMFPlone
        Products.ATContentTypes

    [sources]
    Products.CMFPlone = git https://github.com/plone/Products.CMFPlone.git branch=plip-12344-plone.app.contenttypes
    Products.ATContentTypes = git https://github.com/plone/Products.ATContentTypes.git branch=davisagli-optional-archetypes


Differences to Products.ATContentTypes
--------------------------------------

The image of the News Item is not a field on the contenttype but a behavior that can add a image to any contenttypes (similar to http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.contentleadimage)
