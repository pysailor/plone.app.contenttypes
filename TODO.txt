Plone Conference 2012 Arnhem Meeting - Open Space
=================================================

  [X] Migrate skin templates to browser views

      plone.app.content (no PLIP needed)
  [ ] Use behaviors for lead image / event

Future
------

  [ ] Write AT migration steps (gsoc?)
  [ ] Integrate plone.app.event
  [ ] Discuss PLIP to change the standard types (e.g. combine file and image)
  [ ] PLIP lead image


Todo
====

 [ ] Search indexes. Search for content in any of the custom fields does not work now.

 [ ] Fix AddPloneSite form which selects which content-type framework to use.

     1. Determine which framework is available within the form (radio selection) [Done]

       * do not provide the option to select a framework unless both are available

       * only allow selection of a content-type framwork from within the advanced form view

       * By default use the Archetypes content-types framework

     2. Fix the default content generation setupstep to work with both Archetypes and Dexterity.

 [ ] Migration steps for base content-types

 [ ] (Issue) The Discussion Item (Comment) is installed even when "No base content-types" is selected in the Plone addform.

 [ ] (Issue) The Document (Page) content type is missing presentation mode.

 [ ] (Issue) The Folder content type is missing functionality to set locally addable types.

 [ ] Migration steps for customized content-types? Is this possible?

 [ ] Documentation. What kind of documentation do we need?

 [ ] Write PLIP to factor out ATContentTypes dependency from
